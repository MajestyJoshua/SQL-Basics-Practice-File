## 📌 **Introduction**  
As a database developer consultant for **Splendor Analytics**, this project involved designing, implementing, and managing a **fully functional SQL database system** to store and analyze data related to **students, courses, instructors, and enrollments**.  

The database was built using **Microsoft SQL Server**, with a strong focus on **efficiency, normalization, and query optimization**.  

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**  
✅ **Design a relational database (3NF)** for structured data management  
✅ **Create and populate tables** for students, courses, instructors, and enrollments  
✅ **Ensure data integrity** using **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints**  
✅ **Run SQL queries** to retrieve, filter, sort, and analyze student records  
✅ **Fix SQL errors** and implement best practices in database management  

---

## 🛠️ **Database Design & Normalization**  
The database was designed following **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.  

📌 **Key Tables in the Database:**  
1. **Students** – Stores student details & enrollment history  
2. **Instructors** – Holds instructor profiles & contact information  
3. **Courses** – Contains course details & assigned instructors  
4. **Enrollments** – Manages student-course relationships & grades  

✅ **Normalization Justification (3NF):**  
- **1NF** – Ensured unique records, set primary keys  
- **2NF** – Removed partial dependencies  
- **3NF** – Eliminated transitive dependencies  

---

## 📂 **Table Creation & Data Insertion**  
### 📌 **Database Setup**  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE SplendorAnalyticsDB;
USE SplendorAnalyticsDB;
```

### 📌 **Table Creation (Primary & Foreign Keys Defined)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY (1,1),
    Name VARCHAR(30),
    Email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    EnrollmentDate DATE
);
```
Similar table structures were created for **Instructors, Courses, and Enrollments** with appropriate **constraints**.

### 📌 **Data Insertion (Realistic Nigerian Details)**
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (Name, Email, EnrollmentDate) VALUES 
('Chukwuemeka Okonkwo', 'chukwuemeka.okonkwo@splendor.edu.ng', '2023-01-10');
```
✅ **Over 20 students, 25 instructors, 25 courses, and 30+ enrollments were added!**  

---

## 🚀 **Error Handling & Debugging**  
### 🔴 **Error 1: Identity Insert Error (Msg 544)**  
**Fix:** Used `SET IDENTITY_INSERT ON` when inserting manual IDs.  

### 🔴 **Error 2: String Truncation (Msg 2628)**  
**Fix:** Increased column size:  
```sql
ALTER TABLE Courses ALTER COLUMN CourseLevel VARCHAR(15);
```

### 🔴 **Error 3: Invalid Object Name (Msg 208)**  
**Fix:** Selected the correct database before running queries:  
```sql
USE SplendorAnalyticsDB;
```

✅ **All errors were successfully resolved!**  

---

## 🔍 **Data Analysis & Query Execution**  
The following **SQL queries** were executed to retrieve, filter, and sort the data.  

### **📌 Retrieving Data**  
```sql
-- Get all enrolled students' names & IDs
SELECT StudentID, Name FROM Students;
```

### **📌 Filtering Data**  
```sql
-- Get students enrolled in 'Advanced' courses
SELECT Students.StudentID, Students.Name 
FROM Students 
JOIN Enrollments ON Students.StudentID = Enrollments.StudentID
JOIN Courses ON Enrollments.CourseID = Courses.CourseID
WHERE Courses.CourseName LIKE '%Advanced%';
```

### **📌 Sorting Data**  
```sql
-- Get all students sorted alphabetically
SELECT StudentID, Name FROM Students ORDER BY Name ASC;
```

### **📌 Distinct Queries**  
```sql
-- Retrieve unique course levels
SELECT DISTINCT CourseLevel FROM Courses;
```

---

## 📊 **Results & Findings**  
✅ **The database structure works efficiently** in storing and retrieving student, instructor, and course data.  
✅ **Filtering and sorting operations function as expected**, making data analysis easier.  
✅ **SQL queries produce accurate insights** into student enrollments and performance.  

---

## 🔧 **Challenges & Solutions**  
| **Challenge** | **Solution** |
|--------------|-------------|
| Identity Insert Error | Used `IDENTITY_INSERT` when necessary |
| String Truncation | Increased column size using `ALTER TABLE` |
| Invalid Object Name | Selected correct database before executing queries |
| Data Redundancy | Applied 3NF normalization |

✅ **All challenges were overcome successfully!**  

---

## 📌 **Conclusion & Future Recommendations**  
The Splendor Analytics database system was **successfully implemented** with:  
✔️ **Efficient data storage and retrieval**  
✔️ **Strong referential integrity**  
✔️ **Fully functional query execution**  

### 🔹 **Future Enhancements:**  
🚀 Implement **Stored Procedures** for automated reports  
🚀 Introduce **Triggers** for real-time student performance updates  
🚀 Optimize **Indexes** to improve query performance
